# Window Walker

##Concept

**A puzzle game where you adjust the size of your window to move your character and other objects around!**

##Platform

This game, by necessity, will only be available on desktop or laptop browsers.

##Story

Your goal is to escape from captivity by "bending spacing" through changing the size
of the window to move yourself and objects and escape individual rooms. The story of
the game is not the focus, and, thus, will not be emphasized. It will simply be in place to
give the player direction and purpose.

##Esthetics

*Window Walker* will have minimalistic, abstract sprites in order to promote clarity
and readability for the puzzles. There will be sounds for basic movement of both you and
the objects that you move, as well as simple background music that will either  emphasize
the idea of the player escaping captivity or solving puzzles.

##Gameplay

###Mechanics

The player's goal is always to escape the room and progress onto the next one.
They do this by resizing the window of their browser to move the objects in the room,
block obstacles, obtain collectables, and even move their character. They will be
able to move their character without adjusting the window, though.

###Control

The player will be able to move their character left and right with the A and D keyes, respectively.
They will also be able to use their mouse to resize the window of the game.

###Teaching The Game / Player Learning

The player will be instructed by text in order to learn the very basic controls and the objective.
Afterwards, the player will be left on their own to solve the puzzles laid out before them.

##About the developer

I am Michael Pasquarello, a second year at RIT, and I have loved games of all sorts since I was a very young child.
After finding an interest in math and programming in school, I decided it would be a good idea to pursue my interests at RIT's
Game Design and Development program. I am proficient in C# and java and am looking to expand that list of languages.
